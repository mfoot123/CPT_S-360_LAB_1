* CptS 360 / Spring 2023 / Lab 1

If you're reading this, you've successfully accepted the GitHub
Classroom assignment and you have a repository set up. The next step
is to clone it and start working.

** Cloning

You can access the clone links on GitHub like this:

[[./static/clone.png]]

I recommend setting up SSH-based authentication for your GitHub
account because it means you don't have to rely on password-based
authentication or deal with GitHub's access tokens. You can [[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account][add an
existing key]] or [[https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent][generate a new one]].

If you don't want to use SSH, the alternative is HTTPS. GitHub phased
out password-based authentication a while back, so if you want to use
this method you'll have to add a "personal access token". Click your
profile icon in the upper right and click on settings:

[[./static/settings.png]]

Then go down to the bottom of the lefthand panel and click on
developer settings:

[[./static/developer-settings.png]]

Go to ~Tokens (classic)~:

[[./static/tokens-classic.png]]

And generate a classic token:

[[./static/generate-token.png]]

You'll have to check the boxes corresponding to what permissions you
want available when you use this token.

If you're using SSH then you'll run this command:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
git clone git@github.com:CPTS-360-SPRING-2023/Lab1.git
#+END_QUOTE

If you correctly configured your keys then it should run without any
prompt.

If you're using HTTPS with a GitHub access token then you'll run this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
git clone https://github.com/CPTS-360-SPRING-2023/Lab1.git
#+END_QUOTE

Enter your GitHub username and the token that you generated
earlier. The token is only shown once when it's generated, so you'll
have to store it somewhere safe if you want to use it multiple
times. A password manager would be appropriate.

** Assignment Instructions

The instructions are on KC's website [[https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/LAB1.html][here]]. The files in this repo are
from the ~samples/~ directory [[https://eecs.wsu.edu/~cs360/samples/LAB1/][here]], conveniently divided into part 1
and part 2 directories. There are also the with the addition of
~mk.sh~ and ~t.c~ files in each part. To do the assignment you'll edit
~t.c~ and run ~mk.sh~ to compile your code. After running ~mk.sh~ you
can run the result with ~./a.out~, or run ~./mk.sh && ./a.out~ to
automatically compile and run in one command.

+ The provided ~myprintf~ binary file is a program which serves as a
  sample solution for part 1.
+ The ~ptable~ binary is the sample solution for part 2.
+ ~vdisk~ is a virtual disk image with a master boot record and a few
  partitions on it.

Part 2 of the assignment roughly corresponds to section 7.3 in KC's
book /Systems Programming in Unix\/Linux/.
